"# SWAIAM-3-" 
Reducing energy consumption and monitoring the units consumed. To make the 
electrical apparatuses insightful and give solace to devoured and to lessen control 
utilization in web applications. Suggested it in light of Arduino uno controller and IoT
innovation. On the off chance that any altering happens, the controller will send to 
information to the server and in addition, it is chopped down the vitality supply naturally.
There is no proper way to know the consumer's maximum demand, usage details, losses
in the lines, and power theft. A system is considered to be intelligent when it can make 
the decisions and can work upon without any human interference.
Similarly, the water meter and gas meter have their own disadvantages, and we can
also integrate water and gas energy meters with electric meter helps users to track three
different meters reading in one application and website.
In order to avoid all these drawbacks, we have intended to construct an IOT based
energy metersso that the proposed energy meter measures the amount of power consumed
of all three-meter electric, water and gas which uploads it to the cloud from which the
concerned person can view the reading
