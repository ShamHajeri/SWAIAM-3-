Reducing energy consumption and monitoring the units consumed. To make the 
electrical apparatuses insightful and give solace to devoured and to lessen control 
utilization in web applications. Suggested it in light of Arduino uno controller and IoT
innovation. On the off chance that any altering happens, the controller will send to 
information to the server and in addition, it is chopped down the vitality supply naturally.
There is no proper way to know the consumer's maximum demand, usage details, losses
in the lines, and power theft. A system is considered to be intelligent when it can make 
the decisions and can work upon without any human interference.
Similarly, the water meter and gas meter have their own disadvantages, and we can
also integrate water and gas energy meters with electric meter helps users to track three
different meters reading in one application and website.
In order to avoid all these drawbacks, we have intended to construct an IOT based
energy metersso that the proposed energy meter measures the amount of power consumed
of all three-meter electric, water and gas which uploads it to the cloud from which the
concerned person can view the reading

In the project SWAIAM-3, we have implemented a smart energy meter which will collect the meter readings of Electric, Water and Gas meter and provide billing facility to consumer using Web application interface. Our main aim of the project was to reduce the manpower and human errors. We have overcome this by implementing efficient sensors like Reed switch and YF-S201 which will collect the meter readings. Our next aim was to provide real-time data monitoring, which we have delivered by providing customers with the Web/Application interface wherein they can monitor their daily, weekly and monthly usages and pay their bills accordingly. We also aimed at integrating all the three services and we have done this efficiently by using a single Node MCU 8266 module. During the execution of this project, we have faced some problems related to usage of sensors and microcontrollers. We researched about various and tried various sensors and microcontrollers to implement this project. Since we have used Node MCU module with ESP 8266, this project can be implemented only in buildings having Wi-Fi connection.
